            Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually include: difficulty thinking and understanding, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and inability to create new memories. Alois Alzheimer
            described the first patient found to be suffering from suffering from dementia over 100 years ago.
            <sup>
              <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>
            </sup> Over that time lots of progress regarding the diagnosement and treatment of AD. The disease usually appears in the 60+ age range, but cases have been diagnosed as early as 27 in early onset cases. Some scientists have hypothesized that AD
            is really not a disease, at least not in the technical sense, but it’s more like a syndrome. Regardless though AD is quite clearly a pretty complex phenomenon whatever it may actually be.

            Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research is progressing at a steady pace as of the time this is being written. That being said AD is still somewhat poorly understood. A couple of the current hypotheses for the causes include:

            <br>
            <div class="hypo">
              <li>

                <a href="#tau">&tau; Protein hypothesis</a>

          <div class="co" id="beta">
            <img src="images/amyloid-b.png" alt=""> The Amyloid-&beta; hypothesis was first thought up in 1991
            <sup>
              <a href="#cite2">[2]</a>
            </sup>, it postulates that because of a quirk in how &beta;-secretase and &gamma;-secretase cleave Amyloid precursor protein (APP), there is some left over atoms that are called a peptide. These peptides have nowhere to go once they’re cleaved.
            So they tend to clump together in bunches called plaques
            <sup>
              <a href="#cite3">[3]</a>
            </sup>.

          <div class="co" id="tau">
            <img src="images/TANGLES_HIGH.jpg" alt=""> The &tau; Protein hypothesis states that &tau; or tau proteins are the cause for AD. &tau; proteins are stabilizing proteins that help cells undergo mitosis. The issue with them is that they tend to stick together over time and can build
            up inside a cell potentially disrupting the cells processes and killing the cell. These formations of tau proteins known as tangles
            <sup>

            There is a general consensus in the scientific community about the importance of these 2 hypotheses. As there is a lot of evidence linking both theories to AD. The main point of conjecture is the exact processes that causes these issues that lead to Alzheimer’s
            disease.

            The effects of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are pretty adverse and wide ranging. They can range from to obvious general confusion to depression, hallucination, paranoia, or poor muscle coordination.

            <hr>
          </div>
          <div class="co">
            With AD there are two categories of neuro-physical effects. These effects are called “Positive” and “Negative” features
            <sup>
              <a href="#cite5">[5]</a>
            </sup>. Positive features are manifest in the amyloid plaques, and &tau; tangles along with other cellular junk. Negative features include loss of neurons, and neuron connections. A good example of a negative feature is the significant atrophy of
            the hippocampus can be seen in patients with AD.

          <div class="co" id="end">
            The brain is an extremely complex organ, and often all it takes is one small change to a person's neurochemistry to completely alter their perception of reality
            <sup>
              <a href="#cite6">[6]</a>
            </sup>. So as one can imagine damage on the scale of what is seen in AD has a extremely adverse effect on the personality and cognition of a patient. Alzheimer's is an exceptionally cruel disease because of the way it doesn’t just kill the person
            or put them through pain. It instead erroades at the very thing that makes them who they are.
